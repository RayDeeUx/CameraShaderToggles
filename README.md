# CameraShaderToggles

Allows individual toggles for each type of camera/shader trigger during gameplay, as opposed to the "No Shaders", "No Camera Move", and "No Camera Zoom" blanket treatment options provided with [Mega Hack](https://absolllute.com) or [OpenHack](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/prevter.openhack/).

Simple demo, with all shader triggers disabled and all camera triggers (except zoom, static, mode, and guide) disabled:
