# CameraShaderToggles

Allows individual toggles for each type of Camera, Shader, or Area trigger during gameplay, as opposed to the "No Shaders", "No Camera Move", and "No Camera Zoom" blanket treatment options from other mod menus such as Eclipse, Prism, or Mega Hack.

Simple demo, with all shader triggers disabled and all camera triggers (except zoom, static, mode, and guide) disabled:
